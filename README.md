# CCUX ‚Äî Claude Code UI Generator

> Generate professional landing pages from your terminal

**Open source and completely free**

## What is this?

CCUX is an open-source CLI tool that uses Claude AI to generate conversion-optimized landing pages in minutes. It analyzes competitors, creates user research, and outputs production-ready HTML/React code with TailwindCSS.

## Why I built this

As a developer, I was tired of:
- Switching between multiple design tools
- Spending hours on landing page decisions  
- Getting mediocre results from drag-and-drop builders

I wanted professional landing pages generated with proven UX methodology, straight from my terminal.

## Who is it for?

- **Indie hackers** testing product ideas quickly
- **Startups** shipping MVPs without design bottlenecks
- **Developers** who want to stay in terminal workflow
- **Freelancers/Agencies** needing faster client deliverables
- **Anyone** who prefers code they own over SaaS builders

## How it helps

- **Save time**: Generate pages in 3 minutes vs 3 days
- **Better conversions**: Uses 12-phase UX methodology agencies charge $1000s for
- **Stay focused**: No context switching from terminal to design tools
- **Own your code**: React/HTML output you can modify and deploy anywhere
- **Smart research**: Automatically analyzes 3 competitors for design inspiration

## What problem it solves

**The Problem**: Creating professional landing pages requires design skills, UX knowledge, competitor research, and hours of work.

**The Solution**: CCUX automates the entire process:
1. Finds and analyzes 3 competitor sites automatically
2. Runs professional UX research (personas, user journeys, wireframes)
3. Generates strategic copy and design system
4. Outputs production-ready code you can deploy immediately

## Prerequisites

- **Claude CLI** - Install from [claude.ai/code](https://www.anthropic.com/api)
