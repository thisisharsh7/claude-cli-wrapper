# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CCUX (Claude Code UI Generator) is a sophisticated Python CLI tool that automatically generates conversion-optimized frontend landing pages using professional UX design thinking methodology. The tool leverages Claude AI to implement a comprehensive 12-phase design process used by professional UX agencies, combining automated competitor analysis with strategic design decisions.

## Claude Integration

### Purpose of Claude Integration
This project integrates with the Claude CLI to provide automated UI/UX design intelligence. Claude AI powers:

1. **Reference Discovery**: Automatically finds 3 competitor websites based on product descriptions
2. **Design Analysis**: Analyzes captured screenshots for UI patterns, strengths, and weaknesses
3. **User Research**: Creates empathy maps, personas, and user journeys
4. **Strategic Copy**: Generates conversion-optimized copy based on competitive analysis
5. **Code Generation**: Produces production-ready HTML/React components with TailwindCSS

### Claude CLI Usage
The tool invokes Claude CLI using:
```bash
claude --print "prompt content here"
```

**Special Notes:**
- **Timeout Protection**: 5-minute timeout per Claude invocation to prevent hanging
- **Token Management**: Automatically summarizes product descriptions >100 words to 100-150 words to optimize token usage
- **Usage Tracking**: Parses and displays input tokens, output tokens, and estimated costs from stderr
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error capture with user-friendly messages
- **Streaming Output**: Real-time progress indication during Claude processing

## Commands Reference

- **Content Intelligence**: Makes contextually appropriate changes that fit the existing tone and style

**What You Can Edit:**
- Text content, headlines, copy, and messaging
- Pricing information and call-to-action text  
- Feature descriptions and benefits
- Testimonials and customer quotes
- Company descriptions and value propositions
- Contact information and links
- Image alt text and descriptions
- Add new content sections or elements
- Modify existing content structure within sections

**What Stays Preserved:**
- Design theme styling (colors, fonts, spacing, shadows)
- Overall layout and visual hierarchy
- Navigation system and smooth scrolling
- Form functionality and CTA links
- Animation system and interactive elements  
- Responsive breakpoints and mobile compatibility
- Section markers for future regeneration
- All CSS classes and design system patterns

**Usage Tips:**
- Be specific in your edit instructions for best results
- Use `--sections` to focus changes and avoid unintended modifications
- The command auto-detects theme and context from existing files
- Edit history is preserved in design_analysis.json for tracking changes
- Works with both HTML and React framework outputs
